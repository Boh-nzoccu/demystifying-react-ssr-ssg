# Demystyfing React SSR/SSG

## What is SSR?

SSR stands for Server Side Rendering. It is a technique used in web development to render the initial view of a web page on the server instead of the client. The server will send the initial view of the web page to the client. The client will then download the JavaScript bundle and render the rest of the web page on the client.

## Why SSR?

There are two main reasons why SSR is used:

-   **SEO** – The search engines will index the content of a web page even if the page is rendered on the client. The search engine bots will not be able to index the content of a web page if it is rendered on the client.
-   **Performance** – The initial render of a web page will be faster because the server will render the initial view of the web page. The client will not need to download the JavaScript bundle and render the initial view. This will improve the performance of the web page.
